1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
**The most interesing thing I covered in domain is working with Selenium and using an automated brower, which taught me a new way to collect data.**
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
**One potential investigation I would like to pursue is testing pretrained sentimental analysis models for any bias, many of which are highly cited and used by organizations for content moderation.**
3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
**One potential approach i would like to make is to include Google in the project. At first, we got rid of Google, but by using VM, we may be able to run both websites and collect enoiugh data.**
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
**One technique I would be interested in using in my project is different ways of auditng an already pretrained model and determining bias, (e.g. statistical tests).**
